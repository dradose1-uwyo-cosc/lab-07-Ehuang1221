# Prompt the user for an upper bound 
# Write a while loop that gives the factorial of that upper bound
# This will need to be a positive number
# For this you will need to check to ensure that the user entered a number
    # To do so you can use the methods `.isdigit()` or `.isnumeric()`
    # If a user did not enter a number output a statement saying so
# You will continue to prompt the user until a proper integer value is entered

factorial = 1
while True:
    upper_bound = input("Enter an integer for factorial calculation: ")
    if upper_bound.isdigit():
        upper_bound = int(upper_bound) # Makes sure it's an integer
        for i in range(1, upper_bound + 1): # Iterates from up to bound
            factorial *= i
        break

print(f"The result of the factorial based on the given bound is {factorial}")

# Create a while loop that prompts a user for input of an integer values
# Sum all inputs. When the user enters 'exit' (regardless of casing) end the loop
# Upon ending the loop print the sum
# Your program should accept both positive and negative input
# Remember all inputs from stdin are strings, so you will need to convert the string to an int first
# Before you convert the number you need to check to ensure that it is a numeric string
    # To do so you can use the methods `.isdigit()` or `.isnumeric()`
    # This will return true if every digit in your string is a numerical character
    # However, that means a string such as `-1` would return false, even though your program should accept negative values
    # This means you will need to have a check to see if `-` is first character of the string before you check if it is numerical
    # If it is in the string you will need to remove the `-` character, and know that it will be a negative number, so a subtraction from the overall sum
    # I recommend checking out: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_replace.asp to figure out how one may remove a character from a string
# All this together means you will have an intensive while loop that includes multiple if statements, likely with some nesting 
# The sum should start at 0

while True:
    user_input = input("Enter an integer to add, or 'exit' to quit: ")

    elif user_input.lstrip('-').isdigit():   # left strips the negative sign to check if it's a digit should still work as negative
        num_sum += int(user_input) # converts to integer and adds it to sum

# Now you will be creating a two operand calculator
# It will support the following operators: +,-,/,*,% 
# So accepted input is of the form `operand operator operand` 
# You can assume that the user is competent and will only input strings of that form 
# You will again need to verify that the operands are numerical values
# For this assume only positive integers will be entered, no need look for negative numbers 
# You will need to check the string for which operator it contains
# Once you do, you will need to remove the operands from the string
# This can be done in multiple ways:
    # You can go through the string in a loop and create a substring of the characters until an operator is reached
        # Upon reaching the operator you will switch to another substring and add all characters following to the second new string 
    # Alternatively you can use the `.split()` method to split the string around an operator: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_split.asp
# Your program will need to work with whatever spacing is given  
    # So, it should function the same for `5 + 6` as `5+6`
# Print the result of the equation
# Again, loop through prompting the user for input until `exit` in any casing is input 

while True:
    equation = input("Enter an equation in 'operand operator operand' form with spaces (or type 'exit'): ")
    if equation.lower() == 'exit':

    if len(parts) != 3:  # Check that we have exactly 3 parts
        print("Please enter in the form: operand operator operand")
        continue

    operand1, operator, operand2 = parts

    if not operand1.isdigit() or not operand2.isdigit():  # Ensure operands are digits
        print("Operands must be integers. Please try again.")
        continue

    operand1, operand2 = int(operand1), int(operand2)

    # Check and perform the operation
    if operator == '+':
        result = operand1 + operand2
    elif operator == '-':
        result = operand1 - operand2
    elif operator == '*':
        result = operand1 * operand2
    elif operator == '/':
        result = operand1 / operand2
    elif operator == '%':
